Hey guys so this is something that I have been assigned to do in the odin project. I am well aware of the fact that I might have given up on coding at various points in the past dropping odin project just a few chapters after this point but this time i am sure that i will make it through. It has been a refreshing journey in the odin project after dropping it. I have actually studied all the lessons again and this time a bit more depth in the assigned links along with the supplementary material.
